#Random Name Generator#
Generates a first and last name out of some of the most popular names in the U.S.
##Coming soon##
Hopefully, I will be able to turn this into a twitter bot. That's why I separated the name generator into a different class.
##To run##
To run, just cd into the directory where you downloaded the name generator. 'ruby main.rb' to start it.
